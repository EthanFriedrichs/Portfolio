            <h3>I wonder how this works...</h3>
            <p>At eight years old, playing on a very old monitor, an awakening question suddenly hit me; "I wonder how this works?" And ever since I looked at everything with intent on understanding on how it worked. So I decided that I should know it more, so every day I would play, understand, and watch the computer. Take this to a couple of years later, I find myself in a programming class in highschool, designing my own projects that are made purley for fun. And I loved every bit of seeing a computer work from just simple words, lines, and functions. Designing my own games, screensavers, and helpful programming shortcut functions all for no benefit other than my own satisfaction.</p>
